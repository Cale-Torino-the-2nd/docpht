## :bug: Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Email us directly at `securitybugreport@docpht.org` with details and repro steps. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
